{{< insert-desc "substrate-logo-pixelated.png" "Cumulus is a set of tools for writing Substrate-based Polkadot parachains. It's easy to write blockchains using Substrate, and the overhead of writing parachains' distribution, p2p, database, and synchronization layers should be just as low. This project aims to make it easy to write parachains for Polkadot by leveraging the power of Substrate." >}}
